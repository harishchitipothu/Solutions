Serverless application 
    1
Create Service Role 
S3,CodePipeline,Lambda,API Gateway,CloudFormation

    2
Application Setup
Sam Template - samTemplate.yaml
CodeBuild Spec - Buildspec.yml

    3
Create Pipeline
Source,Build
you can create change set,Approve change set,Execute change set

First You need to create service role for CloudFormation in IAM 
and also we need to add service polocy 'those are mentioned in CFnServiceRole.json file' in git hub.
In that CFnServiceRole.json file we're giving permissions to S3 , Lambda,Api Gateway,IAM,CloudFormation and CodeDeploy.

Make sure that you need to provide AWS account ID and Region 

I'm using simple phython based example which will give the availability zones to you

I've sam template.yaml file this will defines the serverless application 
defining lambda function 

Buildspec.yaml file we're going to convert sam template into cloudformation template 
make sure that s3 bucket is created before the lambda execution.


after that create pipeline and give the source provider 'git hub' choose your repository from list.
you can select build provider AWS CodeBuild provide needed info to fields.
By deafult this service role will not have s3 write permissions,so we need add those.
choose deployment provider would be cloudformation.

In that code pipeline it self can approve the code.
after that can take action deploy.
go to Api Gateway access that URL can able to get availability zones
