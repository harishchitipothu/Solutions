In my previous organization i never tried these type of request.
I use to get request build a EC2 instance and load balancer and RDS instance something like that.
I never use the service called EQS and AWS GraphSql API.
SNS service we used to when RDS instance goes beyond 80% will get notification by using SNS handlers,But i never used ing cloudformation template 
created by using console.
I used Lambda function in order to get the AMI backup's for the VM ,one lambda function will take backup and
another lambda function will check if backup of those AMI is more than 10 days clean it.

Serverless application 
    1
Create Service Role 
S3,CodePipeline,Lambda,API Gateway,CloudFormation

    2
Application Setup
Sam Template - samTemplate.yaml
CodeBuild Spec - Buildspec.yml

    3
Create Pipeline
Source,Build
you can create change set,Approve change set,Execute change set

First You need to create service role for CloudFormation in IAM 
and also we need to add service polocy 'those are mentioned in CFnServiceRole.json file' in git hub.
In that CFnServiceRole.json file we're giving permissions to S3 , Lambda,Api Gateway,IAM,CloudFormation and CodeDeploy.

Make sure that you need to provide AWS account ID and Region 

I'm using simple phython based example which will give the availability zones to you

I've sam template.yaml file this will defines the serverless application 
defining lambda function 

Buildspec.yaml file we're going to convert sam template into cloudformation template 
make sure that s3 bucket is created before the lambda execution.


after that create pipeline and give the source provider 'git hub' choose your repository from list.
you can select build provider AWS CodeBuild provide needed info to fields.
By deafult this service role will not have s3 write permissions,so we need add those.
choose deployment provider would be cloudformation.

In that code pipeline it self can approve the code.
after that can take action deploy.
go to Api Gateway access that URL can able to get availability zones
